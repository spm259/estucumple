# Why Use a Dependency?:
# In FastAPI, we use dependencies to inject things into our API functions. In this case, get_db() will inject a database session whenever itâ€™s needed.
# This ensures that every time we make a request, we have a fresh session, and after the request is complete, the session is properly closed.
